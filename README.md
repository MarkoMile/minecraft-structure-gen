# Abstract

A practical implementation of the Shap-e model was made as an integration into the computer game "Minecraft". The final results are generated structures based on a text prompt, with the aim of reducing the amount of time that professional teams of players spend on building projects in this computer game. The resulting STF was sampled to create the voxel mesh. After that, it was downsampled to remove anomalies and gaps. For all calculations and comparisons related to colors and textures, the CIE lab color space was used due to its better overlap with human color perception and linearity compared to the RGB color space. In order to create the color mapping to the blocks, the median cut algorithm was used to find the color that best represents the block. That color representation is used to calculate the Euclidean distance of the colors in the TF from the Shap-e object and the in-game blocks, thereby obtaining a matching color representation of the Shap-e generated in-game object using Minecraft blocks. The final result is satisfactory, taking into account the limitations of the Shap-e generative model, and the practical application of the Shap-e model is demonstrated.

# Usage

Prerequisites:
 * Minecraft server that is set up for RCON.

Navigate to the [src](src/) directory and install with `pip install -e .`.

To get started with the program:

 * Use [generate_latents.ipynb](src/generate_latents.ipynb) to generate latents and export color and coordinate data.
 * Use [minecraft_inject.py](src/minecraft_inject.py) to inject the structure into your Minecraft server.

Note: You must change the predefined server password and port for RCON in [minecraft_inject.py](src/minecraft_inject.py).
